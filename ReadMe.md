# Charity Search App

The Charity Search App is a tool that allows the user to browse IRS-approved nonprofit organizations. Once the user enters their zipcode, the app shows them the names of 20 charitible organizations. The user can then select an organization to learn more details such as the name, mission statement, category and URL. Afterwards, the user can add another zipcode to the list they have generated, or exit the app.
